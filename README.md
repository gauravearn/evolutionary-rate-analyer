# evolutionary_rate_analyer
A R function for the analysis of the evolutionary rates from the fasta files, and uses the ka/ks and the dn/ds and plots the evolutionary rates. a evolutionaryAlignment function that calculates the evolutionary
rates across the fasta file, given a fasta file, it will automatically align the sequences and then will estimate the evolutionary rates on the clean alignments. I coded in a way that you have just provide the directory path and it will output the results.
